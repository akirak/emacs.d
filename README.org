   :CUSTOM_ID: installation
   :END:

You can use [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs-playground][playground]] to try out this configuration.

To properly install this configuration, first back up your current
configuration and then use Git to clone the repository:

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
    git clone https://github.com/akirak/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d 
#+END_EXAMPLE

Dependencies and extra configuration files, which are configured in my [[https://github.com/akirak/nixos-config][nixos-config]] repository, can be installed using Nix package manager and [[https://github.com/rycee/home-manager][home-manager]].

After starting Emacs with the configuration, you have to run
=all-the-icons-install-fonts=.

** Overview of the initialization process
1. Emacs loads [[file:init.el][init.el]].
   1. [[file:main.org][main.org]], the rewritten version of my configuration, is loaded.
   2. [[file:old-init.el][old-init.el]] loads my previous configuration which have not been migrating yet.
