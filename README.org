There are great Emacs configuration repositories on GitHub. The following repositories are my favorites:

- [[https://matthewbauer.us/bauer/][Emacs + Nix IDE by Matthew Bauer]]
- [[https://github.com/purcell/emacs.d][emacs.d by Steve Purcell]]
- [[https://github.com/kaushalmodi/.emacs.d][.emacs.d by Kaushal Modi]]

[[https://github.com/alphapapa][Alphapapa (Adam Porter)]] is one of the most active Emacs package developers in the world, and I rely on quite a few packages and ideas by him. I definitely recommend that you take a look at his stuffs if you want to make the most of Emacs.
