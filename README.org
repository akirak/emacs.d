- [[https://travis-ci.org/akirak/emacs.d.svg?branch=core]] [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs.d/tree/core][core]], which only provides a framework for customization
- [[https://travis-ci.org/akirak/emacs.d.svg?branch=base]] [[https://github.com/akirak/emacs.d/tree/base][base]] offering a set of less-opinionated features

* Features

  - Display keybindings via which-key
  - Keep ~/.emacs.d directory clean with help of no-littering 
  - Reduce clutter in the modeline using diminish
- [[file:lisp/ak-visual-cues.el][Visual cues]] (highlight-indent-guides, rainbow-delimiters, and fill-column-indicator)
