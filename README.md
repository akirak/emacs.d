# emacs.d

This is an attempt to write an Emacs initialization file from scratch. I had been a long-time user of Vim, then switch to Spacemacs last year, but now I want to use Emacs without extra layers of Spacemacs. 

I am not using this configuration right now. I write this configuration using Spacemacs and try it in another instance of Emacs. 

## Installation

    git clone https://github.com/akirak/emacs.d.git ~/.emacs.d

## Features
