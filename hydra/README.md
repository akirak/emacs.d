# Emacs Hydra Collection

This is a collection of [Hydra](https://github.com/abo-abo/hydra) applications I implemented. They may require dependencies that are not part of this repository. 

## Usage

Bind keys to the following commands:

- `akirak/toggle-modes-hydra/body`, which lets you toggle minor modes for programming.
- `akirak/hydra-launcher-for-major-mode`, which launches a hydra depending on the major mode of the current buffer.
