* Overview of configuration
** Menu key for help                            :help:keybinding:microhabit:
Use ~<menu>~ key as a prefix for alternative help commands. Especially, the following kinds of commands should bound on this prefix:

- Help/referencing commands specific to modes of the current buffer.
- Dictionary commands (for natural languages).

There is already ~<f1>~ (or ~C-h~ by default) for help commands, but these are about Emacs. If you want to get a context-specific help, try ~<menu>~.

*** Tutorial hydra                       :microhabit:keybinding:help:hydra:
By convention, ~<menu> h~ should be bound to a Hydra command for the major mode.
